# **Building an Instagram Clone Web App**
This project is part of the SOEN 341 - Software Process class at Concordia University.

## **The Task**
In a team of maximum 7 students, implement an application (Instagram) using any programming language/ scripting language, frameworks, or any other tools of choice. All members of your team must have a good understanding of the tools used. Your documentation, both internal and external, must be clear enough to be easily understandable by a reader who may not be familiar with the language or tools used.

The completed application will have 4 features. Three will be provided by the instructor, the 4th feature will be decided by students.

## **Technologies Used**
### **> Programming language**
[Modern JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#:~:text=ECMAScript%20(or%20ES)%20is%20a,pages%20across%20different%20Web%20browsers.) / `ECMA Script 6+` will be used in this project as the main programming language.

### **> Framework**
We chose to build our web app with `React` framework. See the [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) guide. Quick start guide on how to [create a new React app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

### **> Database**
We are planning to choose [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to host images, posts and other data in our app.

### **> Other Tools**
#### `Redux`
> Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. 

[Read on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redux_(JavaScript_library)) or see the **Tutorials** section below.

#### `npm`
> `npm` is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. 

[Read on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)) or see the **Tutorials** section below.

#### `NodeJS`
> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

[Read on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) or view a short explanation video in the **Tutorials** section.
